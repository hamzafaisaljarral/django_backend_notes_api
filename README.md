# Backend Coding Challenge

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Thermondo/backend-code-challenge/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/Thermondo/backend-code-challenge/actions)

We appreciate you taking the time to participate and submit a coding challenge. In the next step we would like you to
create/extend a backend REST API for a simple note-taking app. Below you will find a list of tasks and limitations
required for completing the challenge.

### Application:

* Users can add, delete and modify their notes
* Users can see a list of all their notes
* Users can filter their notes via tags
* Users must be logged in, in order to view/add/delete/etc. their notes

### The notes are plain text and should contain:

* Title
* Body
* Tags

### Optional Features ðŸš€

* [ ] Search contents of notes with keywords
* [ ] Notes can be either public or private
    * Public notes can be viewed without authentication, however they cannot be modified
* [ ] User management API to create new users

### Limitations:

* use Python / Django
* test accordingly

### What if I don't finish?

Try to produce something that is at least minimally functional. Part of the exercise is to see what you prioritize first when you have a limited amount of time. For any unfinished tasks, please do add `TODO` comments to your code with a short explanation. You will be given an opportunity later to go into more detail and explain how you would go about finishing those tasks.

### To test the api and run them 
list of main api
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/auth/login/ (to login)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/auth/register/ (to register your self)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/users/auth/logout/ (to logout from account)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/ (can see the login user list of notes and add the new notes using it )
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/update/(id) (to call update api)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/delete/(id) (to call delete api)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/notes/filter/?search=created (to filter your notes on base of tags)
